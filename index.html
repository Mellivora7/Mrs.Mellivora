		<h1>Ek is lief frou jou my liefie!</h1>
			<p>This Valentine's day I decided that I will take a minute to just appreciate my loving wife! I figured this would be a great day to just take the time to reminisce about our odd journey.</p>
		<h2>Almost two years ago, it started with her commenting on one of my reels</h2>
			<img src="Screenshot.jpg">
			<p>This woman commented on one of my Instagram reels. I noticed she was a into BJJ and being a martial artist myself I messaged her. I didn't think anything of it. I was just talking to a woman that I thought was attractive.</p>
		<h2>A year later I was scheduled to fight in June.</h2>
			<img src="Fight.jpg">
			<p>I asked Mari if she would like to watch me fight. She flew out to see me and that month leading up to the fight was the hardest I have ever trained for something. I WAS NOT losing in front of a woman who I was sure was the love of my life.</p>
		<h2>The second she got off the plane I knew that I wanted to marry her.</h2>
			<img src="firstvisit.jpg">
			<p>I had already been talking to Mari every day for almost a year, so I knew her values aligned with mine. I was not expecting that someone so amazing would be interested in coming up to see me, but here she was right in front of me.</p>
		<h2>So after my fight we both agreed we were perfect for one another</h2>

			<p>The next few months were great, but I was unable to deny that only seeing my then girlfriend a week at a time and having to call her was not enough. We would fly out to visit, but eventually we decided it was time for a shift.
		<h2>I went to texas, rounded her up and brought her back</h2>

			<p>We got married the day after we made it home. What an amazing wedding, I thought it wasn't going to be that great if I am honest. We thought it would just be a little ceremony where we could finally say we had found our person. BUT MAN WHAT FUN DID WE HAVE, HOW COOL IS IT THAT MY WIFE MARRIED ME IN A BOXING RING? GOD I LOVE HER</p>
		<h2>I have so much love for this woman!</h2>
			<p>I have plenty of reasons to feel the way I do. Amazing cook, frequent hot meals, she comes to the gym with me. She is extremely affectionate and supportive. Also, DAT BOOTY. 10/10, I love her!
		<h2>I LOVE YOU!</h2>
